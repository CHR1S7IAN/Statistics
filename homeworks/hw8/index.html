                <h3>Discussion and Comparison</h3>

                <h4>HMWK 4 (Law of Large Numbers) vs. HMWK 7 (Random Walk)</h4>
                
                <p>
                    The fundamental analogy between Homework 4 (coin toss) and Homework 7 (server security) is that **both are based on a Bernoulli Process**: a sequence of independent random experiments, each with two possible outcomes (e.g., Heads/Tails, Secure/Breached).
                </p>

                <p>
                    The **key difference** is not in the underlying process, but in *what we measure and visualize*:
                </p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Homework 4 (Law of Large Numbers):</strong> We plotted the **relative frequency (the mean)**, i.e., $S_n / n$ (where $S_n$ is the number of "successes" after $n$ trials). The goal was to show *convergence*: as $n$ increases, the graph of the mean tends to stabilize on a single value, the theoretical probability $p$.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Homework 7 (Random Walk):</strong> We plotted the **cumulative score (the sum)**, $X_n$ (where $X_n$ is the sum of the +1 and -1 results). The goal was to show *diffusion*: as $n$ increases, the trajectories do not converge to a point, but "disperse," exploring an ever-wider range of values.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    In summary, HMWK 4 shows that the *mean* of the process converges, while HMWK 7 shows that the *sum* of the process diffuses.
                </p>

                <h4>Random Walk and Binomial Coefficients</h4>

                <p>
                    The distribution of the final scores in the Random Walk (the bar chart in HMWK 7) is not random. It is a **Binomial Distribution** (shifted and scaled). Why?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Let's imagine $n$ weeks (steps). To get a final score $S$, we must have had $k$ "secure" weeks (+1) and $(n-k)$ "breached" weeks (-1).
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The final score is: $S = (k \times +1) + ((n-k) \times -1) = k - n + k = 2k - n$.</li>
                    <li>Solving for $k$: $k = (S + n) / 2$.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The number of different *ways* (or paths) to get exactly $k$ successes in $n$ trials is given by the **Binomial Coefficient**:
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 1.2em; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">
                    $C(n, k) = \binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is why the histogram of final scores in HMWK 7 has that bell shape: the central scores (near 0) are more probable because there are many more *paths* (combinations) that lead to that result, compared to the extreme scores (like $+n$ or $-n$, for which only one path exists).
                </p>

                <hr>

                <h4>Pascal's (Tartaglia's) Triangle</h4>

                <p>
                    Pascal's (or Tartaglia's) Triangle is a geometric visualization of precisely these binomial coefficients.
                </p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>Each number in the triangle is the sum of the two numbers above it.</li>
                    <li>Row $n$ of the triangle (starting from $n=0$) lists all the binomial coefficients $C(n, k)$ for $k$ from 0 to $n$.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    If we interpret the triangle as a "Random Walk," starting from the apex (row 0), each number $C(n, k)$ in row $n$ represents **exactly the number of possible paths** to arrive at that position after $n$ steps (assuming one can only move down-left or down-right).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Row $n=50$ of the triangle (impossible to draw here) would give the exact shape of the (non-normalized) distribution we saw in HMWK 7 for 50 weeks.
                </p>

                <h4>Binomial Expansion and Fibonacci Sequence</h4>
                
                <p>
                    The connection is even deeper:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Binomial Expansion:</strong> The coefficients $C(n, k)$ are the same ones that appear in the expansion of the binomial $(x+y)^n$. 
                        <br>
                        $(x+y)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} x^{n-k} y^k$
                        <br>
                        If $x=y=1$, we get $(1+1)^n = 2^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k}$. This tells us that the sum of the numbers on row $n$ of the triangle is $2^n$, which is exactly the **total number of possible paths** in a random walk of $n$ steps.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Fibonacci Sequence:</strong> There is also a hidden relationship with the Fibonacci sequence (1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8...). If you sum the numbers along the "shallow diagonals" of Pascal's Triangle, you get the Fibonacci numbers. 
                        [Image of Pascal's triangle with Fibonacci diagonals]
                        This shows a surprising connection between combinatorial problems (like counting paths) and recursive sequences.
                    </li>
                </ul>
