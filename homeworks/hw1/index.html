      <h3>The Role of Statistics in Cybersecurity</h3>
          
          <h4>What is Statistics?</h4>
          <p>
            Statistics is the scientific discipline concerned with collecting, analyzing, interpreting, and presenting data. Its main purpose is to transform raw data into meaningful information to understand phenomena, identify trends, and make decisions based on numerical evidence. Instead of relying on anecdotes or intuition, statistics uses mathematical methods to manage uncertainty and draw reliable conclusions.
          </p>

          <h4>Why is it Useful in Cybersecurity?</h4>
          <p>
            In the digital world, the amount of data generated every second is immense (system logs, network traffic, user behaviors). Cybersecurity can leverage statistics to analyze this mass of data and turn it into a powerful defense tool. Here are some practical examples:
          </p>
          
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Anomaly Detection:</strong> Statistics allows for the creation of a "normal behavior" model for a system or network. For example, the average volume of data transferred by a user per day can be calculated. When an activity deviates significantly from this norm (e.g., a data transfer 100 times larger), the statistical system flags it as an anomaly, which could indicate an ongoing attack or a data breach.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Predictive Threat Analysis:</strong> By statistically analyzing historical data on cyberattacks (type, origin, targets), it is possible to identify patterns and trends. This allows for predicting which types of threats are most likely in the future and preparing defenses proactively rather than reactively.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Risk Assessment:</strong> Through probabilistic models, statistics helps to quantify risk. For example, one can calculate the probability that a certain vulnerability will be exploited and estimate the potential financial impact. This information is crucial for deciding where to invest security resources.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Spam and Phishing Filtering:</strong> Modern anti-spam filters use statistical analysis (such as Bayes' theorem) to calculate the probability that an email is malicious, based on the frequency of certain words, the sender's reputation, and other characteristics.
            </li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>
            In conclusion, statistics is not just a branch of mathematics, but a fundamental pillar of modern cybersecurity. It allows a shift from a defense based on reacting to known threats to an intelligent, predictive strategy capable of identifying unknown dangers by analyzing data.
